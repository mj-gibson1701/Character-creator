Dwarf,250,40,49.5,40.5,191,149,0,0,2,0,2,-2,"Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, the dwarves have a reputation as dour and humorless craftsmen of the earth. It could be said that dwarven history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins and other such horrors.","Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.","Medium, Slow and Steady, Darkvision, Defensive Training, Greed, Hatred, hardy, Stability, Stonecunning, Weapon Familiarity, Language"
Halfling,100,20,35.2,28.8,36,30,-2,2,0,0,0,2,"Optimistic and cheerful by nature, blessed with uncanny luck and driven by a powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easy-going, halflings like to keep an even temper and a steady eye on opportunity, and are not as prone as some of the more volatile race to violent or emotional outbursts. Even in the jaws of catastrophe, a halfling almost never loses his sense of humor. Halflings are inveterate opportunists. Unable to  physically defend themselves from the rigors of the world, they now when to bend with the wind and when to hide away. Yet a halfling's curiosity drives them to travel and seek new places and experiences, halflings possess a strong sense of house and home, often spending above their means to enhance the comforts of home life.",Their inherent luck coupled with their insatiable wanderlust makes halflings ideal for lives of adventure. Other such vagabonds tend to put up with the curious race in hopes that some of their mystical luck will rub off.,"Small, Slow Speed, Fearless, Halfling Luck, Keen Senses, Sure-Footed, Weapon Familiarity, Languages"
Elf,350,110,70.4,57.6,137,101,0,2,-2,2,0,0,"The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to fey creatures, yet different as well. Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends, at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is accepted as a comrade, such alliances can last for generations. Elves have a curious attachment to their surroundings, perhaps as a result of their incredibly long lifespans or some deeper, more mystical reason. Elves who dwell in a region for long find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on coloration reflecting the local environment. Those elves that spend their lives among the short-lived races, on the other hand, often develop a skewed perception of morality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of companions age and die before their eyes.","Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded forest realms to reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their forefathers. For those raised among humans, the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds natural appeal. Elves generally eschew melle because of their fraility, preferring instead to pursue classes such as wizards and rangers.","Medium, Normal Speed, Low-Light Vision, Elven Immunities, Elven Magic, Keen Senses, Weapon Familiarity, Languages"
Human,70,15,63.8,52.2,203,113,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Humans possess exceptional drive and a great capacity to endure and expand, and as such are currently the dominant race in the wrld. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and the citizens of these societies carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is best characterized by its tumultuousness and diversity, and human cultures run the gamut from savage but honorable tribes to decadent, devil-worshiping noble families in the most cosmoploitan cities. Human curiosity and ambition often triumph over their prediction for a sedentary lifestyle, and many leave their homes to explore the inumerable forgotten corners of the world or lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors, simply because they can.","Ambition alone drives countless humans, and for many, adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether it be wealth, acclaim, social status, or arcane knowledge. A few pursue adventuring careers simply for the thrill of danger. Humans hail from myraid regions and backgrounds, and as such can fill any role within an adventuring party.","2 to One Ability Score, Medium, Normal Speed, Bonus Feat, Skilled, Languages"
Gnome,200,40,39.6,32.4,41,35,-2,0,2,0,0,2,"Gnomes trace their lineage back to the mysterious realm of the fey, a place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder, and emotions more primal. Unknown forces drove the ancient gnomes from that realm long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots or adapted to moral culture. As a result, gnomes are widely regarded by the other races as alien and strange.","Gnomes' propensity for wanderlust makes them natural adventures. They often become wanderers to experience new aspects of life, for nothing is as novel as the uncounted dangers facing adventurers. Gnomes make up for their weakness with a proclivity for sorcery or bardic music.","Small, Slow Speed, Low-Light Vision, Defensive Training, Gnome Magic, Hatred, Illusion Resistance, Keen Senses, Obsessive, Weapon Familiarity, Languages"
Half-orc,60,14,63.8,52.2,298,144,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Half-orcs are monstrosities, their tragic births the result of perversion and violence - or at least, that's how other races see them. It's true that half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for themselves. Feared, distrusted, and spat upon, half-orcs still manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom - though sometimes it's easier just to crack a few skulls","Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot through force of arms. Others, more optimistic or desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to prove their worth to the world.","2 to One Ability Score, Medium, Normal Speed, Darkvision, Intimidating, Orc Blood, Orc Ferocity, Weapon Familiarity, Languages"
Half-elf,125,20,68.2,55.8,180,110,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Elves have long drawn the covetous gazes of other races. Their generous life spans, magical affinity, and inherent grace each contribute to the admiration or bitter envy of their neighbors. Of all their traits, however, none so entrance their human associates as their beauty. Since the two races first came into contact with each other, the humans have held up elves as models of physical perfection, seeing in the fair fold idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many elves find humans attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which members of the younger race play out their breif lives. Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads to romantic relationships. Though usually short-lived, even by human standards, these trysts commonly lead to the birth of half-elves, a race descended of two cultures yet inheritor of neither. Half-elves can breed with one another, but even these ""pureblood"" half-elves tend to be viewed as bastards by humans and elves like.","Half-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering the lands in search of a place they might finally call home. The desire to prove oneself to the community and establish a personal identity - or even a legacy - drives many half-elf adventures to lives of bravery.","2 to One Ability Score, Medium, Normal Speed, Low-Light Vision, Adaptability, Elf Blood, Elven Immunities, Keen Senses, Multitalented, Languages"
